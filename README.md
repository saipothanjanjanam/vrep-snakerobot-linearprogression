# Prerequisites (dependencies)
  
  **Matlab/Octave Installation**
  
  MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed   by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of     user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python.

  Matlab can be found in the Products section of the [Mathworks website](https://in.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo)
  
  **V-REP Installation**
  
  The robot simulator V-REP, with integrated development environment, is based on a distributed control architecture: each       object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS or BlueZero node, a remote API client, or   a custom solution. This makes V-REP very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in       C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.
  
  V-REP can be found in the Downloads section of the [Coppelia Robotics website(http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html)
